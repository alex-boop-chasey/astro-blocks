You are working directly in my Astro + Tailwind project.

Project conventions right now:
• Astro 5.x + Tailwind (no custom CSS files)
• Components: 
  - src/components/ui/         → small/atomic (Button, Pill, Card, Badge, etc.)
  - src/components/sections/   → full page sections (Hero, Features, CTA, Pricing, etc.)
• Main showcase page: src/pages/index.astro
  - It has a components array with {name, path, description}
  - Each component gets a <section> with title + live preview
• Current body has dark theme (bg-gray-950/gray-900)

Task:
From the attached screenshot, create or improve the matching component(s).

Rules & expectations:
1. Choose best name & location (ui/ or sections/)
2. Make it very configurable via props + slots
3. Support dark mode properly (use dark: where needed)
4. Mobile-first + good responsive breakpoints
5. Excellent accessibility (semantic tags, contrast, focus)
6. Modern Tailwind feel (subtle shadows, smooth gradients, glass if appropriate)
7. TypeScript props interface
8. Clean code + useful comments

Gallery integration:
- Update src/pages/index.astro automatically:
  • Add import
  • Add entry to components array (name, path, short one-line description)
  • Add new <section> with live preview
- For full-width/hero-like components: make preview full-bleed 
  (remove container/max-w, use w-full, minimal or no padding/border on preview wrapper)
- For smaller/atomic components: keep classic boxed preview (border, padding, subtle bg)

Do NOT:
- Ask questions
- Output code in chat
- Create unnecessary new files/folders
- Use container/max-w-* on full-bleed section previews

Just do the work directly in the files.

Screenshot / design to match as closely as possible:
[your detailed description here]

Examples of good descriptions:
- Very dark gradient (indigo-950 → purple-950 → black), huge centered headline, announcement pill at top center, two big CTAs at bottom (primary filled + secondary text link), tall vertical rhythm, edge-to-edge background
- Three feature cards in grid, each with icon, title, short text, subtle hover lift
- Pricing table with 3 columns, most popular middle card with badge & different bg
